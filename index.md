I'm Peter, a software developer based in the Philadelphia area.

I have 10+ years of experience in full-stack web development with deep knowledge
of JavaScript/TypeScript as well as proficiency in Python and Scala.

I value mission-driven work and tend to gravitate towards smaller companies
where I can learn a lot and take on different challenges. I work well across
teams and disciplines and like to understand the "why" of what's being built so
I can be as effective as possible with my technical contributions.
